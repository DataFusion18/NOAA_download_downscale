# NOAA_download_downscale
# This is a repository for files related to the spatial and temporal downscaling of NOAA GEFS data for use in the forecasting # of water quality at Falling Creek Reservoir, Virginia. The files here are still far from finalized - the goal for completion # is January 2019. At that time everything should be much more readable!

# run_downscaling.R runs the downscaling process and calls all other required functions (which are also stored within the repository)
